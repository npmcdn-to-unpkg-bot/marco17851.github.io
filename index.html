						<td>I am working on an Android application that focuses on sexual health and sexual wellness. Since I am a trained Sexual Health Peer Advisor at Dartmouth College, I decided to create an application that will enable students at Dartmouth (and elsewhere) to find quick and easy information about a variety of sexual topics. I am working with a friend who is also a peer advisor. She is creating the graphics and the illustrations for the application. The categories that we decided should be included</td><td>are sexual health, birth control, STIs, pregnancy information, sexual identity and gender expression, kinks, and resources (both at Dartmouth and nationwide). While the focus of the application is to educate Dartmouth students into making safer choices when it comes to sex and knowing the resources on campus, the application will include resources for young people nationwide. I will also provide links to prominent organizations such as Planned Parenthood where students can learn even more.</td>

						<td>The Tiny Search Engine was a series of labs for my Software Design and Implementation course at Dartmouth College. Our goal was to design and implement a basic search engine. We had to be able to crawl webpages, index the webpages and obtain the information that we needed, and query through those webpages when the user needed to find something "online". Written in C and tested with baSH scripts, the tiny search was able to crawl through webpages</td><td>given to us by our professor. A great deal of the information was stored in nodes, and the information was utimately placed in files that the other parts of the project were able to utilize. Ultimately, the tiny search engine was able to obtain any specific words from the user, search through the indexed files for the respective words and their webpages, and finally print out the webpages where the words are found, in the order with the highest ranked webpages first.</td>

						<td>The A-Maze-ing Project was the final project for my Software Design and Implementation course at Dartmouth. We were to find a way for avatars inside the maze to find each other, without knowing anything about the maze, except where the other avatars were located. As a result, my partners and I created our own maze depending on where the avatars</td><td>were going and where they were finding walls. This project involved setting up a connection to a server, being able to make each avatar talk to the server one by one, work with different processes, implement an algorithm to find the other avatars, implement a way to create our own maze, and ultimately, show the solution to each maze with simple graphics.</td>
